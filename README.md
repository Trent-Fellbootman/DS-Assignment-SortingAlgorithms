# DS-Assignment-SortingAlgorithms

This is the archive for a project I did when taking the course "Data Structures and Algorithms".

This repository is a 3D game project developed with Unity. Its purpose is to demonstrate how various sorting algorithms (quick sort, etc.) works visually in 3D.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE
Unity project files are too large for Git. This repository contains source code only. A zip archive of all project files is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xcVNj8c0L4_302AteScL2UaNet66TY2v/view?usp=sharing).
